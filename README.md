This repository contains the explorations and final working prototype of a data viz website that illustrates the CO2 impact of Email Data Transfers

I started working with an email dataset of over 3000 emails logged by one individual in 2012. 
The dataset originally had multiple parameters, but I modified the data set to contain the following:
Read/Unread emails, spam, number of recipients, images, and attachments. Additionally, also retained the number of words and links per email. 
While working with this data set, I wanted to make a zoomable packing chart/icicle chart, however, that did not entirely work out as I faced challenged with creating a hierarchy in the JSON file across the 3000+ emails. 

I pivoted to working on the earlier prototype of "Invisible CCs" focusing on the addition of CO2 from each component of the email. 

Faced some errors in pushing git files, and wasn't able to get GitPages running from this rep > migrated the code to another rep > published sucessfully. 
In case needed, second rep for reference: https://github.com/aryaagohad/CarbonPayload_DataViz.git
